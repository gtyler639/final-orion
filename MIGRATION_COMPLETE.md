# Migration Complete: Legacy â†’ React âœ…

## Summary

Your Orion application has been successfully migrated from a legacy vanilla JavaScript implementation to a modern React SPA (Single Page Application).

## What Was Done

### âœ… Frontend Migration
1. **React Components Created**
   - Home page with hero section and feature cards
   - Resume rewriter with text/file input toggle
   - Cater (resume tailoring) with job URL extraction
   - Jobfit (job fit analyzer) with scoring system
   - Signup page with form UI
   - Navbar with responsive mobile menu
   - Layout wrapper component

2. **API Integration**
   - All components now use real API calls (no mock data)
   - Centralized API service layer in `src/services/api.js`
   - Proper error handling and loading states
   - Backend endpoints:
     - `/api/rewrite-resume` - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
     - `/api/tailor-resume` - Anthropic Claude
     - `/api/extract-job-description` - Anthropic Claude
     - `/api/analyze-job-fit` - Anthropic Claude
     - `/api/test-api-key` - API validation

3. **PDF Parsing**
   - Added `pdfjs-dist` dependency
   - Created `src/utils/pdfParser.js` utility
   - Resume and Jobfit pages support PDF uploads
   - Text extraction from PDF files

4. **Styling**
   - Comprehensive CSS in `src/styles/main.css`
   - Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
   - Modern UI with consistent branding
   - Loading spinners and error messages

### âœ… Backend Updates
1. **Server Configuration**
   - Updated `server.js` for SPA routing
   - Updated `server-production.js` for production
   - SPA fallback: all routes â†’ `dist/index.html`
   - Static file serving from `dist/` folder
   - CORS configured for development (localhost:5173) and production

2. **Build Configuration**
   - `vite.config.js` optimized for production
   - Code splitting (React vendor, PDF.js chunks)
   - Terser minification
   - Source maps disabled for production

### âœ… Cleanup
- Removed `app/` folder (legacy vanilla JS)
- Removed `stylesheets/` folder
- Removed obsolete documentation files
- Updated README.md with React instructions
- Updated CLAUDE.md with current architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Ensure `config.env` has valid API keys
   - Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000 and test all features

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide
   - Use PM2 for process management
   - Configure Nginx if using custom domain

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Model Name Verification**
   - `server.js` uses `claude-4` which may not be the correct model name
   - Check Anthropic's current model names
   - Update to `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`, or latest

2. **CORS Origins**
   - Update production CORS origins in `server.js` and `server-production.js`
   - Replace `159.203.136.138` with your actual production IP/domain

3. **API Key Security**
   - Ensure `config.env` is in `.gitignore`
   - Never commit API keys to git
   - Use environment variables or secret management in production
